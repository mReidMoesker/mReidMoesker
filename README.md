<h2>About me</h2>
Hello there. My name is Mathew Moesker, and I'm a student working towards my software development diploma.

I am a Software Developer Course graduate from Manitoba Institute of Trades and Technology, a post-secondary education institute based in Winnipeg, Manitoba. I have made many projects, as well as some projects that are set to private until they are functioning to my liking.

While I have made many different kinds of projects, I am currently working on the Godot Game engine in an attempt to bring my ideas to gamer's screens, while also learning GDScript, Godot's own programming language.

I have worked in multiple fields, including the food industry, warehouse, landscaping, and of course, Software Development.

Many attempts were made to make music, but right now the only instrument I play is Guitar.
