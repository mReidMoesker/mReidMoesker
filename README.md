<h2>About me</h2>
Hello there. My name is Mathew Moesker, and I'm a student working towards my software development diploma.

I am currently studying at the Manitoba Institute of Trades and Technology, a post-secondary education institute based in Winnipeg, Manitoba. I plan on becoming a full-stack web developer in the near future, and am currently working on multiple projects that are not yet ready to be released. 

I have worked in multiple fields, including the food industry, warehouse, and landscaping.
